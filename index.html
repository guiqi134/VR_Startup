							<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
							<p>
								Our VR basketball arcade could give you some genuine practice and skills if you like shooting, 
								and you don’t have to worry about all the unpredictable conditions in the real world. Or maybe, 
								you’re just another person who enjoys the swish of basketballs falling into the net.
							</p>
							<h2 id="history">History</h2>
							<p>
								Actually, the idea of this project is proposed by Wenyou. In addition, most members in our group are fond of playing basketball. 
								This project is the most suitable one to accomplish compared with other ideas we have discussed in the first day. 
								It has a clear major goal, and doesn't involve lots of complex features which are hard to finish in one semester. 
								And this is also the right time for our project to come out  under the current COVID-19 situation, 
								we offer those people who love playing basketball a chance to practice at home.
							</p>
							<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
							<strong>Jedi Picking</strong>
							<p>
								We apply this magic picking strategy to make users more convenient. 
								They don’t have to walk to the ball and do the pick action, when the trigger button is pressed, 
								one of the balls will fly to your right hand just like the Jedi force.
							</p>
							<strong>Smooth Throwing</strong>
							<p>
								Instead of using a single frame to determine the force applied to the ball, 
								we average several frames to apply a smooth throwing which won’t be sensitive to the tiny movement of the user like hand shaking.

					<h2 id="trailers">Videos</h2>
						<p style="color: red;">
							Create a 1-3 minute video announcement for your experience. Depending on the maturity of your project, you may frame it as a teaser, a trailer, or a feature highlight: <br/>
							‣ Teaser Video: a short video intended to gain interest of a viewer in an attempt to build
							excitement about what will come next. <br/>
							‣ Trailer Video: a commercial-like advertisement for an experience, that contains a series
							of selected clips from your experience, whether these be artificially created (in which you
							should indicate somewhere “NOT ACTUAL FOOTAGE”) or taken directly from your
							experience (in which no hedge is necessary). <br/>
							‣ Feature Highlight: a “behind-the-scenes” kind of video that gives your users a detailed,
							guided tour of how your virtual reality experience looks and works, often narrated by a
							developer on the team. It’s not necessarily dramatically exciting, but instead focuses on
							specifics of your product in the most favorable light for your potential users or customers. <font color="blue">(I think this one suits our project)</font> <br/><br/>

					<h2 id="logo">Logo &amp; Icon</h2>
					<p style="color: red;">
						A logo/icon to represent your virtual experience. To put you in the right mindset,
						imagine what the logo/icon of your app would look like when running on Windows or Mac. If
						this is your first time designing an icon, consider (as inspiration or literally) using: The Noun
						Project (https://thenounproject.com/). Do bear in mind the licensing issues around icons if
						you decide to go that route. Please don’t copy and then not attribute. Please.
